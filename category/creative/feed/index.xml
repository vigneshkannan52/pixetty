										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fine art portrait photography is a slightly ambiguous genre. Some argue that in order to be considered fine art, an image&nbsp;must feature specific elements. Others claim that we, as photographers, can decide whether our work fits into the fine art genre or not.</p>



<span id="more-40"></span>



<p>It also has patterns that you can use to create your own fine art. Some of these include poses, expressions, and lighting that will add an elegant touch to your portraits.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Use Classic Backgrounds to Highlight the Subject</h4>



<p>More often than not, fine art portraits have very simple backgrounds that put the spotlight on the subjects. Having a very simple background will highlight every feature on your subject’s face, like skin textures, clothes, and the objects they’re holding.</p>



<p>Many fine art portraits have black backgrounds. This creates the illusion of depth and compels the eye to focus exclusively on the model.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="850" height="480" src="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/post-content.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-18" srcset="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/post-content.jpg 850w, https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/post-content-300x169.jpg 300w, https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/post-content-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Use Inanimate Objects</h4>



<p>Editing is definitely optional. If you want to keep your photos as raw as possible, you can still create very stunning fine art portraits. If you’re in the mood to experiment, though, you’re in for a treat!</p>



<p>These items either told a story about their subjects or served as eye-catching decorations. We can learn a thing or two from these masters by using inanimate objects in our photographs.Things like books, flowers, and instruments all have textures that could turn your photos into true fine art portraits. As you look for objects, keep your model’s story in mind.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Be Creative With Makeup and Costumes</h4>



<p>Fine art photography is nothing without its costumes and makeup. Some photographers like to take the traditional route and dress their models using costumes that look like they belong to royalty. Many focus on both makeup and clothes.</p>



<p>You can use anything. I often use thrift store finds in my portraits. They’re unusual, affordable, and vibrant enough for fine art portraits. Be as creative as you want! Use secondhand scarves, hats, dresses, or even gloves. Pretend that you’re preparing for a film role. It sounds silly, but your imagination can take you to the most exciting places if you allow it to.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Don’t Be Afraid of Motion Blur</h4>



<p>In general, motion blur is something many portrait photographers tend to avoid for understandable reasons. Details are something you don’t want to take for granted. However, you should occasionally blur parts of your photo during your shoot or post-production.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The results will show you the importance of getting out of your comfort zone and experimenting with unpredictable techniques.</p></blockquote>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Go Faceless</h4>



<p>As important as facial expressions are, they don’t have to be featured in a portrait. Sometimes, a simple photo of a hand, a strand of hair, or a curved spine can evoke memories far more powerful than a photo of a stranger’s face. There’s something comforting, even relatable, about seeing a human figure and not just an unfamiliar face.</p>



<p>Faceless fine art portraits are ideal for self-portraits, experimental photos, or test shots with subjects who don’t want to show their faces. Taking them will open up a whole new world for you. You’ll have nothing but movements, body parts, and backdrops to focus on.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6. Give Yourself an Editing Challenge</h4>



<p>Editing is definitely optional. If you want to keep your photos as raw as possible, you can still create very stunning fine art portraits. If you’re in the mood to experiment, though, you’re in for a treat!</p>



<p>What you may not notice immediately is how much love he pours into his editing work; his portraits are carefully color corrected to look the way they do. Without his editing skills, he wouldn’t have a powerful signature style.Editing is definitely optional. If you want to keep your photos as raw as possible, you can still create very stunning fine art portraits. If you’re in the mood to experiment, though, you’re in for a treat!</p><p>The post <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/2022/03/27/post-1/">Fine Art Portrait: 6 Tips to Create Your Own</a> first appeared on <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty">pixetty</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinks have all kinds of different textures in photography. It’s our job to communicate what the drink might feel like when it hit our mouths and it’s one of the main reasons I love photographing them.</p>



<span id="more-34"></span>



<p>Backlight can help emphasise texture with clear (or almost clear) liquids that have pulp, bubbles or another ingredient that needs to be highlighted. ⁠⁠Whereas the glass you use can emphasise or hide texture.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1 – Frozen Drink Texture in Photography</h4>



<p>Add height and swirls to frozen cocktails with a small spoon to help the viewer understand the texture. With white frozen drinks, use shadows to enhance the textures.<br>We can see the thick frozen texture in this margarita.<br>A thick and rich hot chocolate.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2 – Thick Drink Textures</h4>



<p>One of my favourite textures in photography when shooting drinks is the thick winter style of a hot chocolate. From the colour of the milk to the thick layer of foam. All of the textures give a feeling of heavy comfort.`</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3 – Pulpy: Provides a Unique Textural Feeling</h4>



<p>Pulpy drinks, like a Lychee Frose, has a different feeling texturally to other thick drinks. Highlighting flecks of the fruit help reveal its pulpy texture.<br>Blended fresh fruit cocktails have a pulpy feeling.<br>A Ramos Fizz is the ultimate creamy cocktail.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4 – Impressive Creamy Textures in Photography</h4>



<p><br>The billowiness of this Ramos Fizz can be seen as the cream is shaken to almost resemble meringue. Capturing the foam spilling over the glass with sidelight reveals the thick creaminess of this cocktail.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5 – Silky Textures: A Must Have</h4>



<p>Chilled whiskey on the rocks is the ultimate silky smooth drink. Highlighting an ultra-smooth feeling, it feels and looks light as air.<br>A glass of whiskey should feel very silky and smooth.<br>Chunks of ice, large or small add texture to a drink.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">6 – Icy Textures in Photography</h4>



<p>Ice feels different from frozen. It’s grainer and crunchier. Crushed ice helps add a different feel to a frozen drink. Using clarity in editing helps enhance this texture.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">7 – Smooth</h4>



<p>Backlight shine helps give a cocktail a smooth feeling. This is especially important for clear spirit-based cocktails like a martini. A martini has a smooth feeling in the mouth and should be photographed the same way. Bubbles freshly captured have a lot of movement and interest.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">8 – Bubbly</h4>



<p>Bubbles help cocktails feel alive! It adds such a fun and unique texture to drinks. Make sure to capture it freshly poured with a fast shutter speed to freeze motion.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">9 – Drink Texture Show Stopper: Foamy</h4>



<p>⁠⁠Foamy drinks are the show stoppers. Using sidelight can help to reveal the bubbles or foam. Capture the foam separating as the cocktail sits (within the first two minutes) for even more interesting textures.</p><p>The post <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/2022/03/27/post-3/">Texture In Photography: 9 Ways to Photograph Texture in Drinks</a> first appeared on <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty">pixetty</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diptychs in food photography are a great way to showcase a food story. It’s something that I often think about when creating new work, even though I don’t always showcase my images using this composition method.</p>



<span id="more-32"></span>



<p>The great thing about Diptychs is that you can use new or old work, even ongoing work to create a story.</p>



<p>In this post we’re going to look at:</p>



<ul><li>What is a diptych and why we use it in photography.</li><li>How it helps us tell a food story.</li><li>3 steps to creating a beautiful diptych.</li><li>Examples of how I have used diptychs.</li><li>Ideas you can use for your diptychs.</li></ul>



<p>Ready to create a Diptych? Let’s get into it.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Diptych?</h4>



<p>Pronounced like <em>‘dip-tik’</em>, a diptych is a presentation of two images together that combined, tell a story. The images could be from the same shoot, or show similar subjects or present contrasting elements.</p>



<p>You could even present images from different shoots that when combined tell more of a story or show a theme than if they were on their own.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">It’s All About The Story You Want to Tell.</h4>



<p>The biggest consideration when creating a diptych is deciding what story you want to tell with your images.</p>



<p>Before you start, what is the message you want to viewer to receive? What do you want them to feel or discover? The answers to these questions will help you to craft and concept the two images.</p>



<p>If both of the images come from the same shoot, you’ll want to think about how to present the images differently. Some ideas of what you can do that are:</p>



<ul><li>Using different focal lengths to capture your subjcect.</li><li>Shooting different angles.</li><li>Cooked vs uncooked food.</li><li>Wide vs narrow captures.</li><li>Different types of lighting.</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/2022/03/27/post-4/">How To Create A Diptych in Food Photography</a> first appeared on <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty">pixetty</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term negative space may sound problematic, but it’s actually an essential component of almost every great image. In fact, if you want to create gorgeous photos, you must master negative space; that way, you can take shots that feature balanced, harmonious, eye-catching arrangements. (You can also capture wonderfully minimalistic compositions, as I discuss down below.)</p>



<span id="more-26"></span>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">What is negative space?</h4>



<p>Negative space refers to areas of a composition that are empty, bland, or otherwise uninteresting. That’s why negative space is also called white space; it’s where nothing is really happening.</p>



<p>In photography, negative space is often made up of certain elements:</p>



<ul><li>Water</li><li>Sky</li><li>Walls</li><li>Sand</li></ul>



<p>Note that all of these elements tend to fade easily into the background, and that’s why they make such great negative space. An empty sky does not draw the eye, any more than a blank white wall, a stretch of empty sand, and so on.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Positive space versus negative space</h4>



<p>Positive space is the complete opposite of negative space. Negative space rejects the eye, while positive space steals the spotlight. You see, positive space is the area of a photo that includes elements of interest, the area that includes the main subject, the area where the viewer’s eye goes first.</p>



<p>In the photo below, there is plenty of positive space, but very little negative space. The flag, the buildings, and the trees all act as positive space. Even the clouds provide some positive space, thanks to their interesting arrangement and texture. The biggest patch of negative space is the sky, which takes up a tiny portion of the shot.</p>



<p>Now, positive space can be anything, but here are some common examples:</p>



<ul><li>Faces</li><li>People</li><li>Buildings</li><li>Birds</li><li>Wildlife</li><li>Mountains</li></ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Let the scene dictate your negative space and positive space combination</h5>



<p>Every scene has a different ratio of negative space to positive space.</p>



<p>And while you, as the photographer, can zoom in, change perspective, and crop to emphasize certain parts of the scene, you need to be flexible; you need to be able to embrace a scene that’s full of negative space, just the same as you embrace a scene filled with positive space.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Use negative space to balance out positive space</h4>



<p>A key goal of photographic composition is to achieve visual balance. You want your images to feel whole, complete, satisfying.</p>



<p>And one way to achieve balance is by identifying your positive space, then countering it with negative space.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Experiment with minimalism</h4>



<p>Minimalistic compositions use negative space to great effect. In fact, they’re all about negative space; they take lots of negative space, include a touch of positive space, and create an eye-catching result.</p>



<p>Here’s an example of a minimalist image, where the shadow acts as positive space, while the bricks provide some empty negative space:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Use negative space to convey emotion</h4>



<p>Negative space tends to be bleak, even melancholy, especially in black and white images.</p>



<p>Use this fact. Tell a story with your composition – a story that’s laced with sadness, or loneliness, or quiet pleasure.</p>



<p>Of course, you should let the scene guide you, as I emphasized above. But you can also carefully add more negative space to your composition by zooming out, or by finding a uniquely empty background, etc.</p><p>The post <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/2022/03/27/post-7/">Negative Space in Photography: The Essential Guide</a> first appeared on <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty">pixetty</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geometric photography is the art of finding and harnessing the world’s geometry through imagery. We use our cameras to turn our geometrical surroundings into powerful and dynamic images.</p>



<span id="more-20"></span>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Lead With Lines</h4>



<p>Once you start looking, you’ll find lines everywhere. Bold, thin, wavy, or sharp—there are countless types of lines. And you can use them to strengthen your composition in geometric photography.</p>



<p>The geometry of lines helps us visualize our surroundings. They define space, momentum, and emphasis. Lines delineate both conceptual and physical designs. They provide a scaffold for ideas and experiences.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Repeat Yourself</h4>



<p>Repetition involves repeating a subject many times for greater impact within an image. You can find geometric shapes that repeat to create patterns throughout your images. With each repetition, the geometry in the image is emphasized. It gives your geometric photography rhythm and structure. The shapes become part of the narrative of your photograph.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Suggest Symmetry</h4>



<p>Symmetry is the visual balance of one or more subjects within a composition. It occurs both naturally and artificially. It is often tied to the geometric properties of a photograph. Symmetry visually and psychologically pleasing to encounter. And it adds an even flow to a photograph.</p>



<p>An image doesn’t need to be perfect to achieve the impression of symmetry. You can find symmetry by using reflections in glass or water. Or you can look for similar geometric shapes in your compositions.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Use Color</h4>



<p>Color can liven up a geometric image, snagging the viewer’s eye. But color also can work on a deeper, more psychological level. Colors are linked to emotional experiences. Different colors hold specific meanings for different people. While red shows passion, blue denotes calmness. You introduce a new layer of experience to geometric photography by incorporating color.</p>



<p>Bringing color theory into your work adds depth and meaning to your geometric photography. You can use different color patterns to give your images a more substantial emotional feel as Turkish photographer Yener Torun displays in the image below.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Try Black and White</h4>



<p>Black and white can’t rely on color to get attention. It depends on shape and form. The contrast of black and white helps create dynamic shapes and lines.</p>



<p>You don’t have blocks of color. But you can find strong shapes made from black and white. And you can also look for contrasting shades of grey.</p>



<p>Black and white photography is about finding light and dark areas. Look for the regions where light meets dark. The light beams and shadows create a world of shape that surrounds you.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Go Textural</h4>



<p>Texture defines the way an image feels. It allows the viewer to connect with a photograph on a physical level. Rough, smooth, wrinkly, or slippery—most subjects are made from textural qualities.</p>



<p>Geometric subjects operate on many textural levels. Polished metallic surfaces give an impression of smoothness and modernity. Weather-worn geometric architecture can feel rough and old. You can almost feel the rough texture of old bricks.</p><p>The post <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/2022/03/27/post-10/">Cool Geometric Photography Ideas</a> first appeared on <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty">pixetty</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting great product photos often seems daunting, but it’s simpler than you might think. As an experienced product photographer, I’ve spent years learning the ins and outs of the craft. And in this article, I aim to share it all.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Get your camera on a tripod</h4>



<p>For one, they protect against blur. Once you mount your camera (or smartphone) on a tripod, then you can lengthen your shutter speed as much as you like without risking camera shake.</p>



<p>So what tripod should you buy? There are a huge variety of tripods available, all with different features and at different price points. As long as the tripod is strong enough to support your gear, you’ll probably be just fine – though if you can afford it, consider grabbing a tripod that can bend your camera over at ninety degrees. That way, you can easily capture popular flat-lay shots for Instagram.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. Use the right lighting for the product</h4>



<p>Yes, there are certain product photographers who spend hours or even days lighting a single setup and getting it perfect. And there are product photographers who work in a studio with a handful of strobes and dozens of modifiers. But while there is a time and a place for slow, complex product photography, it’s not necessary for all product photos, and you can certainly capture great product shots without such difficult lighting arrangements.</p>



<p>In fact, you can do product photography with only natural window light; simply put the product on the table (or even the floor) near a window, make sure it’s angled correctly, and start shooting. (Many people successfully photograph products on a table pulled up to a bright window!)</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Shoot the product from multiple angles</h4>



<p>Product photography is about helping the customer understand exactly what they’re getting. And when people are buying online, they can’t pick the product up, nor can they touch it.</p>



<p>So it’s your job, as the photographer, to convey all the small details to a potential purchaser. The best way to do that? Make sure you capture a variety of product angles. Shoot from above. Shoot from the left and the right. Make sure you emphasize every portion of the product, including all the little details.</p>



<p>Close-up shots are especially important if the item is handmade. By getting in close, you can convey the care and consideration the artisan put into their work. These little details are what differentiates handmade products from their mass-manufactured counterparts – so be sure to show them off!</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Find out how the images will be displayed</h4>



<p>Different product images are used in different ways. For instance, a client might want to use your photos for social media – or they might plan to use your photos on an e-commerce website. Plus, different vendors will have different specifications for how photographs look best on their sites. Some might prefer 3:2 landscape images, while others will work only with square-format files.</p>



<p>And then you should tailor your product photos to their specifications. For instance, if you are shooting for someone with an Etsy store, they might want photos that look great on their product page (generally portrait-orientation shots) and that work well as search thumbnails (these are landscape oriented). So you should carefully capture images that look good when cropped to both portrait and landscape orientations. (You may want to leave plenty of white space around the product, which you can then delete in post-processing.)</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Don’t forget the packaging</h4>



<p>A huge percentage of product sales happen online, so the packing of a product contributes heavily to the first impression of a brand. As a result, artisan companies and small businesses often spend lots of time considering their packaging and branding – which means that you’ll have a beautiful, complementary prop to include in your shots.</p>



<p>You can capture plenty of photos featuring both the product and the box. Try shooting the product in the box, the product on top of the box, and the product next to the box. And if the packaging is interesting enough, shoot it on its own.</p><p>The post <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/2022/03/27/post-11/">Product Photography: 5 Tips for Stunning Shots</a> first appeared on <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty">pixetty</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Architectural photography is something just about every photographer engages in at some point or other, if only casually. Nevertheless, it’s surprisingly tricky to pull off well.</p>



<span id="more-7"></span>



<p>Each building has a mood and personality of its own, and the best photography will not only look good but will capture these qualities as well, allowing the viewers to share in the feel of a place. It’s not as easy as it might look.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Take the Time to Really Get to Know the Space</h4>



<p>To capture the essence of a building, whether inside or out, you’ll need to take some time to get to know it. On a practical level, this means scouting out the location, noticing how the sun travels, where the shadows are at different times of day, checking out the various access points, and seeing where lines converge.<br>Look for unusual angles and unusual perspectives. Notice if and when people are about and decide whether you want to include them in your shot.<br>Watch Your Lines</p>



<p>One of the most important keys to good architecture shots is to make sure your lines go precisely where they’re supposed to. Vertical lines should be vertical, horizontal lines, horizontal. Sounds elementary, but in reality, it can be very challenging, especially if you have to tilt the camera up to get all of a building in the frame.</p>



<p>Parallel lines will start to converge (also known as keystoning), and the building will look like it’s falling backwards. Also, if you’re using a wide-angle lens, you’ll probably have a fair amount of distortion to cope with.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Outdoors: Catch the Light</h4>



<p>As in all photography, lighting is one of the key elements that will make or break your shot. For exterior shots, the old landscape adage holds true here: “shoot during the golden and blue hours.”</p>



<p>The golden hour is the first and last hour of sunlight in a day; the blue hour is the hour before sunrise and after sunset. It’s during these times that you’ll get the best quality of light.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Indoors: Make the Light Work for You</h4>



<p>Lighting-wise, interior shots tend to be more complicated than exterior shots. Unless you’re able to bring your own lighting equipment, you’ll have to make do with the lighting that’s there, which may or may not be easy to work with.</p>



<p>If there are windows, make sure to shoot during the brighter hours of the day to maximise the natural light available. For low-level lighting, you’ll need a tripod for stabilisation during long exposure shots.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t Forget the Details</h4>



<p>Most people focus on capturing buildings as a whole. But shooting from a macro or conceptual level oftentimes will open up an entirely new can of possibilities.</p>



<p>Keep a look out for details and geometric patterns that others might not notice, particularly with older buildings. How do the lines interact with each other? How does the light emphasise the texture of the building materials? Where do the shadows fall?</p>



<p>A little bit of exploration might not only grant you some fantastic shots, but it may also help you discover something new or exciting about the building’s construction or history, allowing you to add more story into your shots.<br>Edit</p><p>The post <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty/2022/03/27/post-12/">Perfect Your Urban Architecture Photography</a> first appeared on <a href="https://vigneshkannan52.github.io/pixetty">pixetty</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
