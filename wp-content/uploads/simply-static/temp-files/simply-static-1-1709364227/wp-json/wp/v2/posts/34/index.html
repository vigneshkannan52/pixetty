From the colour of the milk to the thick layer of foam. All of the textures give a feeling of heavy comfort.`<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3 \u2013 Pulpy: Provides a Unique Textural Feeling<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pulpy drinks, like a Lychee Frose, has a different feeling texturally to other thick drinks.

It\u2019s grainer and crunchier. Crushed ice helps add a different feel to a frozen drink.

This is especially important for clear spirit-based cocktails like a martini. A martini has a smooth feeling in the mouth and should be photographed the same way. Bubbles freshly captured have a lot of movement and interest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8 \u2013 Bubbly<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Bubbles help cocktails feel alive!

Using sidelight can help to reveal the bubbles or foam. Capture the foam separating as the cocktail sits (within the first two minutes) for even more interesting textures.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Drinks have all kinds of different textures in photography.
