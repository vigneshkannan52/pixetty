How do you add feelings to your photos so you can move the viewer and ensure they connect with the piece?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve spent years honing my ability to infuse photos with emotions. And in this article, I\u2019ll share my absolute favorite techniques \u2013 so that you can capture powerful, moving images, too!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, not all viewers experience the same emotions in response to the same photos, so don\u2019t feel pressure to convey specific feelings to everyone. Instead, use these tips, plus your personal emotions, to create powerful, one-of-a-kind images.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Identify your mood before shooting<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The emotional state of the photographer \u2013 that\u2019s you! \u2013 has the largest impact on the emotional quality of your photos. So whenever you head out with your camera, before you take a single shot, or even look for a shot, ask yourself: How am I feeling today? Then let that emotion guide your shooting, and channel it into your photos.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After all, it\u2019s tough to infuse an image with an emotion that you aren\u2019t feeling. If you\u2019re over the moon with happiness, you\u2019ll struggle to find sad or bleak compositions. And if you\u2019re down in the dumps, creating awe-inspiring or uplifting images won\u2019t be easy. So start by identifying your emotions. Look for compositions that align with those feelings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, it\u2019s often worth rechecking your feelings periodically throughout your photoshoot. Depending on the view, the light, chance encounters, etc., emotions can change, and you don\u2019t want to miss out on emotionally resonant shots because you\u2019re searching for the wrong thing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simplify the shot (try using a telephoto lens)<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In wide, busy, expansive scenes, emotions often get lost. Yes, the emotion might be there, but the viewer will have a hard time noticing \u2013 the image may fall a bit flat, at least from an emotional point of view.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So if you\u2019re looking to create emotional photography, consider simplifying the shot. Exclude elements from your frame. Choose a perspective that highlights a single area of interest, not the entire scene.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus on faces<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Faces are full of emotion. The eyes are the windows to the soul, after all, and often show anger, joy, sadness, love, and so much more.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Plus, faces can convey emotions through puffy eyes, tears, wrinkles, etc. So if you want feelings to really shine through, train your lens on people\u2019s faces!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set your camera down and observe<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When I tell people to stop shooting and put the camera away, I often get criticized, yet it\u2019s an important part of photography \u2013 especially photography infused with feelings.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Setting down your camera gives you time to observe the world. Just look around and see what pulls at your consciousness. Ask yourself: What interests me? What draws me? What do I want to capture? What matters to me about this scene?<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These questions only take a minute or two, but they\u2019ll help you identify new, emotionally resonant compositions, plus they might clarify your ideas about a scene and show you the way forward.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Return to the same scenes repeatedly<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Scenes look different on different days, and your feelings are different on different days, too. Take advantage of that fact.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you\u2019re shooting a subject that you can return to, then do it. The street or beach or room or person will have a different feel on different days, especially if you\u2019re photographing outdoors and the weather changes often.<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The best photography often conveys emotions, but how do you create emotional photography?
