Some argue that in order to be considered fine art, an image&nbsp;must feature specific elements. Others claim that we, as photographers, can decide whether our work fits into the fine art genre or not.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It also has patterns that you can use to create your own fine art. Some of these include poses, expressions, and lighting that will add an elegant touch to your portraits.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Use Classic Backgrounds to Highlight the Subject<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>More often than not, fine art portraits have very simple backgrounds that put the spotlight on the subjects. Having a very simple background will highlight every feature on your subject\u2019s face, like skin textures, clothes, and the objects they\u2019re holding.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Many fine art portraits have black backgrounds. This creates the illusion of depth and compels the eye to focus exclusively on the model.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"850\" height=\"480\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pixetty\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/post-content.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/pixetty\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/post-content.jpg 850w, http:\/\/localhost\/pixetty\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/post-content-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/pixetty\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/post-content-768x434.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Use Inanimate Objects<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Editing is definitely optional. If you want to keep your photos as raw as possible, you can still create very stunning fine art portraits. If you\u2019re in the mood to experiment, though, you\u2019re in for a treat!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These items either told a story about their subjects or served as eye-catching decorations. We can learn a thing or two from these masters by using inanimate objects in our photographs.Things like books, flowers, and instruments all have textures that could turn your photos into true fine art portraits. As you look for objects, keep your model\u2019s story in mind.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Be Creative With Makeup and Costumes<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fine art photography is nothing without its costumes and makeup. Some photographers like to take the traditional route and dress their models using costumes that look like they belong to royalty. Many focus on both makeup and clothes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can use anything. I often use thrift store finds in my portraits. They\u2019re unusual, affordable, and vibrant enough for fine art portraits. Be as creative as you want! Use secondhand scarves, hats, dresses, or even gloves. Pretend that you\u2019re preparing for a film role. It sounds silly, but your imagination can take you to the most exciting places if you allow it to.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Don\u2019t Be Afraid of Motion Blur<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In general, motion blur is something many portrait photographers tend to avoid for understandable reasons. Details are something you don\u2019t want to take for granted. However, you should occasionally blur parts of your photo during your shoot or post-production.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The results will show you the importance of getting out of your comfort zone and experimenting with unpredictable techniques.<\/p><\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Go Faceless<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As important as facial expressions are, they don\u2019t have to be featured in a portrait. Sometimes, a simple photo of a hand, a strand of hair, or a curved spine can evoke memories far more powerful than a photo of a stranger\u2019s face. There\u2019s something comforting, even relatable, about seeing a human figure and not just an unfamiliar face.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Faceless fine art portraits are ideal for self-portraits, experimental photos, or test shots with subjects who don\u2019t want to show their faces. Taking them will open up a whole new world for you. You\u2019ll have nothing but movements, body parts, and backdrops to focus on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Give Yourself an Editing Challenge<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Editing is definitely optional. If you want to keep your photos as raw as possible, you can still create very stunning fine art portraits. If you\u2019re in the mood to experiment, though, you\u2019re in for a treat!<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What you may not notice immediately is how much love he pours into his editing work; his portraits are carefully color corrected to look the way they do. Without his editing skills, he wouldn\u2019t have a powerful signature style.Editing is definitely optional. If you want to keep your photos as raw as possible, you can still create very stunning fine art portraits. If you\u2019re in the mood to experiment, though, you\u2019re in for a treat!<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fine art portrait photography is a slightly ambiguous genre.
