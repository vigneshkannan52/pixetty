The images could be from the same shoot, or show similar subjects or present contrasting elements.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You could even present images from different shoots that when combined tell more of a story or show a theme than if they were on their own.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It\u2019s All About The Story You Want to Tell.<\/h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest consideration when creating a diptych is deciding what story you want to tell with your images.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before you start, what is the message you want to viewer to receive? What do you want them to feel or discover? The answers to these questions will help you to craft and concept the two images.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If both of the images come from the same shoot, you\u2019ll want to think about how to present the images differently. Some ideas of what you can do that are:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Using different focal lengths to capture your subjcect.<\/li><li>Shooting different angles.<\/li><li>Cooked vs uncooked food.<\/li><li>Wide vs narrow captures.<\/li><li>Different types of lighting.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Diptychs in food photography are a great way to showcase a food story.
